Overlap and Oversave techniques are widely used in the implementation of linear convolution in Simulink. 

The overlap technique involves dividing the input signals and impulse responses into smaller blocks or frames. 

These blocks are then convolved using the linear convolution operation. 

To account for overlapping portions between adjacent blocks, additional buffer memory is required. 

The oversave technique involves saving and reusing the overlapping portions of the blocks to ensure accurate convolution results. 

By carefully managing the block sizes and overlap lengths, these techniques optimize the computational efficiency and accuracy of linear convolution in Simulink.
